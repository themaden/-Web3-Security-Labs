# Web3 Security Labs

This repository contains various labs demonstrating common security vulnerabilities in Web3 applications, particularly focusing on issues inherited from Web2. Each lab showcases a specific vulnerability, how it can be exploited, and recommendations for securing against such attacks.

## Labs Overview

1. **SQL Injection Lab**
   - **Description**: Demonstrates a SQL injection vulnerability in a Node.js application using Express and SQLite.
   - **Location**: [sql-injection-lab/README.md](sql-injection-lab/README.md)

2. **Weak Authentication Lab**
   - **Description**: Illustrates the risks of relying solely on wallet addresses for authentication in a Web3 application.
   - **Location**: [weak-authentication-lab/README.md](weak-authentication-lab/README.md)

3. **XSS Lab**
   - **Description**: Demonstrates a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in a Node.js application.
   - **Location**: [xss-lab/README.md](xss-lab/README.md)

4. **CSRF Lab**
   - **Description**: Shows a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in a Node.js application.
   - **Location**: [csrf-lab/README.md](csrf-lab/README.md)
